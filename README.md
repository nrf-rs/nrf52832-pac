> Peripheral access API for the nRF52832 microcontroller

This repo contains the sources used to generate the code for the nRF52832
microcontroller from the corresponding SVD files that are also included
in this repo.

We use `svd2rust` to generate the code, `form` to organize it, and `cargo fmt`
to make it pretty.
